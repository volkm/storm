# Developer information

The following contains some general guidelines for developers.


## Structure
- Storm consists of the core library `lib/libstorm` resulting from the source code in `src/storm`.
- Several additional libraries `lib/libstorm-xyz` provide additional features (parametric models, POMPD, DFT, etc.) and are built from the corresponding code in `src/storm-xyz`.
- For each library, a corresponding binary `/bin/storm-xyz` is built from the source in `src/storm-xyz-cli`.
- Functionality is accompanied by tests (`src/test`) whenever possible.
  The complete test suite can be executed by `make test` and individual tests can be executed via the corresponding binaries `bin/test-xyz`.
- Storm is heavily templated.
  In particular, it features the template argument `ValueType` representing the underlying number type.
  The most commonly used types are `double`, `storm::RationalNumber` and `storm::RationalFunction`.

The key source directories are:

| Directory | Output | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `src/storm` | `libstorm` | Core model-checking library |
| `src/storm-cli` | `storm` binary | Main command-line interface |
| `src/storm-dft` | `libstorm-dft` | Dynamic Fault Trees |
| `src/storm-pars` | `libstorm-pars` | Parametric models |
| `src/storm-pomdp` | `libstorm-pomdp` | POMDPs |
| `src/storm-gspn` | `libstorm-gspn` | Generalised Stochastic Petri Nets |
| `src/storm-conv` | `libstorm-conv` | Model conversion |
| `src/storm-parsers` | (part of libstorm) | PRISM and JANI parsers |
| `src/storm-gamebased-ar` | | Game-based abstraction refinement |
| `src/storm-permissive` | | Permissive schedulers |
| `src/test` | | GTest test suite mirroring the library structure |

Each library's public API lives in its `api/` subdirectory (e.g., `src/storm/api/`, `src/storm-pars/api/`).


## Building

Storm uses CMake out-of-source builds. All dependencies must be pre-installed (see [the website](https://www.stormchecker.org/documentation/obtain-storm/dependencies.html) for the exact set). The CI uses the pre-built Docker image `stormchecker/storm-dependencies:latest` which comes with most dependencies already installed.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DSTORM_DEVELOPER=ON
make -j$(nproc)        # Build everything
make storm             # Build only the core library
make storm-pars        # Build a specific sub-library
make test              # Run all tests via CTest
make format            # Apply clang-format to all src/
```

Individual test binaries are placed in `build/bin/`. Run a specific test with:
```bash
./bin/test-storm --gtest_filter='TestSuite.TestName'
```

Important CMake options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `STORM_DEVELOPER` | OFF | Enable extra warnings and assertions |
| `STORM_WARNING_AS_ERROR` | OFF | Treat warnings as errors (used in CI) |
| `STORM_USE_CLN_EA` | OFF | Use CLN instead of GMP for exact arithmetic |
| `STORM_USE_CLN_RF` | ON | Use CLN for rational functions |
| `STORM_BUILD_TESTS` | ON | Build test binaries |
| `STORM_DISABLE_<DEP>` | OFF | Disable optional dependencies (CUDD, GLPK, Z3, …) |


## Coding conventions

### Templates and `ValueType`
New functionality should typically be templated on `ValueType`. Add explicit instantiations at the bottom of each `.cpp` file:
```cpp
template class MyClass<double>;
template class MyClass<storm::RationalNumber>;
template class MyClass<storm::RationalFunction>;
```
New numerical code must be tested under both CLN and GMP configurations (`STORM_USE_CLN_EA` on/off, `STORM_USE_CLN_RF` on/off) since their arithmetic differs in edge cases.

### Infinity
`storm::utility::infinity<ValueType>()` returns a true infinity only for `double`.
For the exact types it returns the literal `100000000000`; it is deprecated and must not be used in new code.

A value that can be infinite is held in `storm::utility::ExtendedValueType<ValueType>`.
This is `ValueType` itself for types that bring their own infinity (`double`, reported by `NumberTraits<ValueType>::HasInfinity`) and `storm::utility::ExtendedNumber<ValueType>` for the rest.
`storm::ExtendedRationalNumber` and `storm::ExtendedRationalFunction` are the aliases for `RationalNumber` and `RationalFunction`.

Use it at the boundaries of a computation: check results, value vectors handed to a caller, bounds passed around as scalars.
Do not use it in hot loops as the extra wrapper can cause unnecessary slowdowns. Often it is possible to filter out any value which would become or are infinte. To detect or set infinities use the following functions:
```cpp
using Extended = storm::utility::ExtendedValueType<ValueType>;
Extended value = storm::utility::positiveInfinity<ValueType>();  // and negativeInfinity<ValueType>()
storm::utility::isFinite(value);            // false
storm::utility::isInfinity(value);          // true; +infinity only, as for double
storm::utility::isNegativeInfinity(value);  // false
storm::utility::getFinite(value);           // throws unless the value is finite
```

The arithmetic follows the extended reals.
`infinity - infinity`, `0 * infinity` and `infinity / infinity` throw an `InvalidOperationException` instead of yielding a NaN, which the exact types have no representation for.
A finite `ValueType` converts implicitly, so mixed expressions need no explicit wrapping.

Converting between the plain and the extended type:
```cpp
storm::utility::widen(std::move(values));                             // vector<ValueType> -> vector<Extended>
storm::utility::narrowFinite<ValueType>(std::move(values));           // throws on an infinite entry
storm::utility::narrowFinite<ValueType>(std::move(values), fallback); // substitutes it instead
storm::utility::narrow<ValueType>(value);                             // one value, throws if it is infinite
```
`storm::utility::convertNumber` takes and returns extended values, so an infinity survives a change of value type.

`fromSentinel` and `toSentinel` bridge the parts of Storm that still produce the `100000000000` literal, mainly the DD leaves.
They cannot tell that literal apart from a genuine value of the same magnitude, and they are removed together with the sentinel, so do not build on them.

### Exception handling
Use `STORM_LOG_THROW` rather than throwing exceptions directly:
```cpp
STORM_LOG_THROW(condition, storm::exceptions::InvalidArgumentException, "Descriptive message.");
```
This throws an `InvalidArgumentException` if `condition` is violated.
Exception types live in `src/storm/exceptions/`.

### Optional dependencies
Code that requires optional dependencies (CUDD, GLPK, Z3, …) must be guarded with the corresponding preprocessor flag from `storm-config.h.in`:
```cpp
#ifdef STORM_HAVE_Z3
  // z3-specific code
#endif
```

### Formatting
- Code should be formatted according to the given rules set by clang-format.
  Proper formatting can be ensured by executing `make format`.
  For more information see [PR#175](https://github.com/stormchecker/storm/pull/175).

### Documentation
- We use Doxygen for documentation, see [storm-doc](https://stormchecker.github.io/storm-doc/).
  Code blocks should be documented with:
  ```
  /*!
   * ... 
   * @param ... 
   * @return ... 
   */
  ```
- Default values for environments are defined in the constructor of the environment (in the corresponding cpp file).

### Includes
- Header files should start with
  ```
  #pragma once
  ```
- Includes should follow the following order:
  ```
  #include "storm/header.h"  // If cpp file
  
  #include <external_library1>
  #include <external_library2>
  ...
  
  #include "storm/additional/headerfile1.h"
  #include "storm/additional/headerfile2.h"
  ...
  ```
  There should only be empty lines between the header file and the external libraries and between the external libraries and the additional header files.
  Clang-format will then automatically sort the includes in alphabetical order.
- Tests follow the same order as before but typically start by including two helper files:
  ```
  #include "storm-config.h"
  #include "test/storm_gtest.h"
  
  #include ...
  ```

### Output
- We provide custom macros for output and logging.
  The use of `std::cout` should be avoided and instead, macros such as `STORM_LOG_DEBUG`, `STORM_LOG_INFO` or `STORM_PRINT_AND_LOG` should be used.
- For line breaks, we use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` to avoid unnecessary flushing.
  See [PR 178](https://github.com/stormchecker/storm/pull/178) for details.


## CI / Continuous Integration

Workflows are in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `buildtest.yml` | PR, daily, manual | Full build+test matrix (Debug/Release, GMP/CLN combos, with/without optional deps) |
| `formatcheck.yml` | push, PR, manual | Checks `src/` with clang-format 20 |
| `formatapply.yml` | manual | Auto-applies formatting and commits |
| `doxygen.yml` | push to master | Publishes API docs |
| `release.yml` | tag push | Publishes GitHub releases |

`buildtest.yml` covers multiple configurations including GMP/CLN combinations and a sanitizer build. A CI failure is most commonly caused by a formatting error (fix with `make format`) or a missing template instantiation for one of the `ValueType` variants.


## Contributing
- Check that all tests run successfully: `make test`.
- Check that the code is properly formatted: `make format`.
  There is also a CI job which can provide automated code formatting.
- New code should be submitted by opening a [pull request](https://github.com/stormchecker/storm/pulls).
  Our continuous integration automatically checks that the code in the PR is properly formatted and all tests run successfully.
